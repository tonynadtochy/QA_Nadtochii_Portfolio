###### Past experience

Appealed by the opportunity to get into a team of excellent IT industry professionals and to grow professionally, I am willing to prove my reputation of being a responsible and quick-witted person among my ex-colleagues.

Please, take a look at my CV:

A brief glance at my previous work challenges reveals that I have extensive practical experience working with documentation and data analysis, as well as acceptance testing of software and technical devices.

###### What kind of person am I? What makes me sure that being Quality Assurance Engineer is a fitting role for me?

I am proactive, meticulous and geeky, always looking forward to new exciting challenges, eager to learn new skills and share my experience with others. Tinkering with different things has always lit me up: rebuilding and upgrading friends’ PCs, testing beta software and firmware releases, soldering microelectronics. 

Growing up in the 2000s, I witnessed mobile phones, laptops and related tech revolutionary changes. It became an illustration of A. Clarke's third law for me. 

> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

After my 9th grade, I’ve spent all my summer break working as a database corrector in order to save up and buy my first smartphone running on Windows Mobile. It opened a whole world of custom firmwares, mobile apps and mobile web to me.

I am a 3d printing enthusiast. I have built, calibrated and modified my 3d printer, learnt to create functional models, as well as modify those already existent. It opened up a source of neat solutions for everyday problems.

I am also an experienced quadcopter pilot. If you shoot some basic videos, you end up with monotonous footage. This led me to taking courses on camera setup basics, approaches to aerial footage filming (scene setup, cinematic camera movement, visual storytelling, color grading, transitions and VFX). I am glad to share a few examples with you:

</a>

When I started learning Python and QA theory, reading through piles of documentation did not confuse me as I have always been the guy who thoroughly read all the manuals, instructions and warnings in order to help my friends and family to set up and troubleshoot their new tech. Learning to code was easier for me because of my experience editing and testing config files of PC games.
